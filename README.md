# Stack Machine

Using test-first TDD, create a function which implements a stack based interpreter. This is a tiny version of a programming language interpreter.

This machine is given a string, containing a sequence of commands. Each command is separated by one space. The commands operate on a stack of integers. Assume that all command strings will be valid sequences without syntax errors.

## Commands to implement

The following commands must be implemented:

- An integer (from 0 to 50000): the machine pushes this integer onto the stack
- "POP": the machine removes the most recently pushed number from the stack
- "DUP": duplicate the last number pushed on the stack (or keep the stack empty)
- "+": pop the most recent two numbers; add them together; push the result. If an overflow occurs (result higher than 50000) return an error done 
- "-": pop the most recent two numbers; subtract the second from the first most recent. push the result. If the result is below zero, return an error done
- "\*" pop the top two elements off the stack, multiply them together, push the result onto the stack
- "CLEAR" empties the stack so it has no elements on it
- "SUM" pops all elements off the stack, adds them together, and pushes the result onto the stack. SUM on an empty stack returns an error. 

Any other input is invalid. the machine must stop and return an error.

After processing all the operations without errors, the machine returns the topmost value from the stack. If an error occurs at any point, the machine stops further processing an returns an error.

All numbers must lie between 0 and 50,000 inclusive. Any result that lies outside this range must stop the machine and return an error.

## Example command sequences

The following examples will clarify what the machine does.

You must write a test for every one. All tests must pass.

### Example: 99

The command "99" will:

- Push the value 99 onto the stack

Result: The machine will pop the most recent value off the stack (99) and return it, without error

### Example: 1 2 +

The command sequence "1 2 +" will:

- Push 1 onto the stack
- Push 2 onto the stack
- pop the numbers off the stack and add them, forming a result of 3
- push this 3 onto the stack

The stack will contain the single value of 3.

Result: The machine will return this value of 3 with no error.

### Example: 3 DUP +

The command sequence "3 DUP +" will:

- Push 3 onto the stack
- Duplicate the most recent value on the stack, making the stack contain [3, 3]
- Plus will take both number off the stack, add them together giving 6 and
- push this result (6) onto the stack

Result: The machine will return 6 and no error

### Example: DUP 99

The command sequence "DUP 99" will:

- duplicate the topmost number on the stack. The stack is empty, so it will leave the stack being empty
- Push 99 onto the stack

Result: The machine will return 99 and no error

### Example: 3 DUP \* 1 +

The command sequence "3 DUP \* 1 +" will:

- Push 3 onto the stack
- Duplicate the 3
- Pop both values off the stack and multiply them, giving a result of 9
- Push this result (9) onto the stack
- Push 1 onto the stack
- Add the most recent two numbers on the stack giving 10
- Push this result (10) onto the stack

Result: The machine will return 10 and no error

### Example: 50000 1 +

the command sequence "50000 1 +" will:

- Push 50000 onto the stack
- Push 1 onto the stack
- Pop the two numbers off the stack and add them
- The result is greater than 50,000 which is an overflow

Result: The machine will stop and report an error

### Example 50001

The command "50001" will:

- Stop the machine due to out of range value

Result: The machine will stop and report an error

### Example: 1 2 3 4 5 SUM

The command sequence "1 2 3 4 5 SUM" will:

- Push the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 onto the stack
- Pop all numbers on the stack and add them up
- Push the result (15) onto the stack

Result: The machine will retun 15 and no error

### Example: XXX-INVALID 1 2 +

The command "XXX-INVALID" will:

- Stop the machine as XXX-INVALID is not a valid input

Result: The machine will stop and report an error

### Example: 2 5 -

The commands "2 5 -" will:

- Push 2 onto the stack
- Push 5 onto the stack
- Pop off the two numbers and subtract
- The result 3 will be pushed on the stack

Result: The machine will return 3 and no error

## Work to be done

- `git clone` from this repo https://github.com/bjssacademy/stackmachine using either https or ssh (your preference; ssh recommended)
- `go install`
- Iterate and create the logic inside the function `func StackMachine( commands string ) (int, error)` to implement the requirements above

And some general advice on approach:

- Use a test-first TDD approach to drive towards a solution
- Think about which order to add support for commands. What order allows you to build on previous working code?
- Steel Threading: Get an operation fully working before moving on
- "Do not eat the whole elephant" - work in small steps
- Make sure you have a test for each one of the worked examples above
- Add tests as required
- Achieve 100% test coverage (using the go test coverage tool)
- Add tests for the operations not listed as examples
- Work in small steps
- Do not implement main()
- run using `go test ./...` or the VS Code IDE
- All unit tests in TestAcceptanceTests() _must_ pass, prior to completion
- Ask for help on your coding channels
- Don't use AI tools. This is thinking practice!

### Assumptions

- The command strings used will always be valid
- Each command will be separated by a single space
